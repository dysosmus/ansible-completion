ansible-completion
==================
Provide a bash completion on host name, module name and options for [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible "ansible git repository").

Installation
------------

 1. Get the `ansible-completion.bash` file.

 2. Copy/move the `ansible-completion.bash` in your `bash_completion.d`
    folder (`/etc/bash_completion.d`, `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d`or `~/bash_completion.d`).

 3. **Or** copy/move it where you want and then load the `ansible-completion.bash` file in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` like that:

 		source ~/ansible-completion.bash

 4. Reload your shell with something like `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.profile`

#### Note for OSX

1. Clone the repo, install bash an auto-completion2 with homebew: ```brew install bash bash-completion2```
2. Change your terminal bash to a homebrew one by setting the ```command``` option to ```/usr/local/bin/bash```
3. Add the following code to your ```~/.profile```:

	```
	if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
	  . $(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
	fi
	```
2. Create a symbolik link for ```	ansible-completion.bash```:

 ```
 ln -vs ~/soft/ansible-completion/ansible-completion.bash /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ansible
	```

Good to know
------------
If the `--module-path` (`-M`) or `--inventory-file` (`-i`) is on the command line, the completion will use it.

For the completion on module name, the completion script build a cache of modules names.<br />
You can set the cache timeout with the environement variable `ANSIBLE_COMPLETION_CACHE_TIMEOUT`, the default value is `120` secondes.
